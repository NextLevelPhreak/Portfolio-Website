				<h2>Concept:</h2>
				<p>This is a style guide for one of the region's largest e-commerce businesses. Their employees kept forgetting their brand colours and using shades of grey, as if entranced by weird skeleton magic. This style guide was built so that the employees can keep everything on-brand.</p>

			<h2>Step 1:</h2>
			<p>The first step was figuring out the logic behind the game, and creating pseudo-code to rough out the JavaScript code. I did this so that I could try some early designs without worrying about getting stuck trying to maintain an inconsistent interface. It was also useful to get an idea of what elements worked together, what worked out of place, and what could be changed to improve the game experience.</p>
			<h2>Step 2:</h2>
			<p>Next I worked on actually creating a model. I found the JavaScript APIs and started playing around with it to create some of the basic models. Some basic structures became extremely important: triangles for polygons.</p>
			<p>So I create an index.html, with this file I create another file, js/app.js. Basically, I worked through a "Master" of the day project and built up more and more confidence with the language.</p>
			<h2>Core Technologies:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>HTML</li>
				<li>CSS</li>
				<li>JavaScript</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Final Result:</h2>
			<p>The final version of this project was just setting up SASS folders and having everything organized.</p>
